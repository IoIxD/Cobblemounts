# useLogScaling = false : 
# movement speed = ((pkmn speed / 256) * (scalar / 2)) + ((legendaryModifier * scalar) / 2)
# useLogScaling = true :
# movement speed = 2.5log((pkmn speed + scalar) / scalar) + legendaryModifier
# For LINEAR scaling, a HIGHER scalar means MORE speed
# LINEAR scaling means that every point of speed matters as much as every other
# For LOGARITHMIC scaling, a HIGHER scalar means LESS speed
# LOGARITHMIC scaling means that movement speed grows faster with low speed stats but slower with more speed stats
# Basically : 
# Linear : low investment, low rewards. medium investment, medium rewards. high investment, high reward.
# Logarithmic : low investment, low-medium reward. medium investment, medium-high reward. high investment, medium-high rewards.

# Ground speed isn't as versatile as flight, so it scales harder.

# Flight is extremely versatile, so its capped at 2. Also, speed 1 is 
# available relatively early for exploration, but speed 2 will require
# a time investment in a speed 350 bird.
# Flight speed 0.5 @ 100 spd
# Flight speed 1 @ 200 spd
# Flight speed 1.5 @ 350 spd

flightSpeedScalar = 450.0  # Linear default : 64.0

# Swimming is the most niche ability, so it's uncapped and scales the hardest.

# Swim speed 2 @ 200 spd
# Swim speed 3 @ 350 spd

swimUseLogScaling = true # Linear default : false
swimSpeedScalar = 300.0  # Linear default : 64.0

# Legendaries get a speed boost accounted for in the formula.
# You may chose to let it bypass the speed caps.
